# Using QGIS survey

**Eliott** to insert screenshots of tablet and explain each piece of the survey. Only focusing on how to use the survey and tablet

## Activity {-}

*Note __Eliott__ this would mean we would have all the tablets pre-prepared with one survey for them to practice collecting data immediately - which I think would be the best course of action*
