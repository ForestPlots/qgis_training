One of the most important steps for collecting data digitally is to be able to access your data. So before diving in to collect data and create a QField project, let's learn how to move documents between your two devices.

**1.** Create a folder on your computer called `QGIS_training`, and save this folder somewhere that you know how to get to and will navigate to often.

**2.** Save this a picture of a very common tree in the Republic of Congo into your `QGIS_training` folder: `r xfun::embed_file("./docs/img/moabi_tree.png",text="moabi_tree.png")`. Do you know what kind of tree it is?

**3.** Connect your tablet to your computer via the cable.

**4.** In your files on the bottom left of your screen, you will see a new device appear. For example, in the image below when an `Apple iPad` was plugged into the device, it appeared.

**5.** Copy your `QGIS_training` folder.

**6.** Paste your `QGIS_training` folder into the tablet area of your device.

**7.** Disconnect your tablet from your computer. Is the image on your tablet?

**8.** This time download a pdf document and save it to your computer and move it to the tablet: `r xfun::embed_file("./docs/material/RAINFOR_data_codes_FR.pdf",text="ForestPlot Codes")`. When you are done, disconnect the tablet from the laptop and check that the pdf is on your tablet.

**9.** Now to move a document from the tablet to your computer, you do the same thing but in reverse. With your tablet disconnected from your computer, take a photo of your neighbor (with their permission) and save it to your `QGIS_training` folder with their name.

**10.** Connect your laptop and tablet via the cable and move the image from the tablet's `QGIS_training` folder into the `QGIS_training` folder on your laptop.

**11** Disconnect your laptop and tablet. On your computer do you have an image of a tree, a pdf, and an image of your neighbor in your `QGIS_training` folder? 

And that's how to move documents between your laptop and tablet.
