How to access ForestPlots data?", " Module 2 Accessing ForestPlots When re-censusing a plot, you need access to the data from the previous censuses in order to make a field sheet, find the plot, and collect the data. You can find everything you need on ForestPlots.net.   What is ForestPlots? ForestPlots.net is a database where you can securely store, manage and analyse tropical forest plot data.   ForestPlots.net stores and serves stem data and metadata for multi- and single-census plots in forests and savannas, including trees, lianas, species, demography, traits and soils. How to access ForestPlots data? In order to access the ForestPlots data, you must Read the code of conduct, Register to have an account on ForestPlots here, and Email the associated country data officer to ensure the account is granted and to receive the necessary training to use ForestPlots. Note: Nika Gorski is the data officer for Africa data. Only once you have completed these steps will you be able to access data to ForestPlots and produce field sheets. If you haven’t fully completed these steps, you can still move on to Module 3 and 4 to install the necessary software on your laptop and tablet.

So before diving in to collect data and create a QField project, let’s learn how to move documents between your two devices. 1. Create a folder on your computer called QGIS_training, and save this folder somewhere that you know how to get to and will navigate to often. 2. Save this a picture of a very common tree in the Republic of Congo into your QGIS_training folder: moabi_tree.png. Do you know what kind of tree it is? 3. Connect your tablet to your computer via the cable. 4. In your files on the bottom left of your screen, you will see a new device appear. For example, in the image below when an Apple iPad was plugged into the device, it appeared.   5. Copy your QGIS_training folder. 6. Paste your QGIS_training folder into the tablet area of your device. 7. Disconnect your tablet from your computer. Is the image on your tablet? 8. This time download a pdf document and save it to your computer and move it to the tablet: ForestPlot Codes. When you are done, disconnect the tablet from the laptop and check that the pdf is on your tablet. 9. Now to move a document from the tablet to your computer, you do the same thing but in reverse. With your tablet disconnected from your computer, take a photo of your neighbor (with their permission) and save it to your QGIS_training folder with their name. 10. Connect your laptop and tablet via the cable and move the image from the tablet’s QGIS_training folder into the QGIS_training folder on your laptop. 11 Disconnect your laptop and tablet. On your computer do you have an image of a tree, a pdf, and an image of your neighbor in your QGIS_training folder? And that’s how to move documents between your laptop and tablet.

If you need a refresher on how to create field sheets, watch this video or visit page 174 of the ForestPlots Manual. If you’ve never been shown how to make field sheets before by a ForestPlots team member, reach out to the data officer of the country that you will be collecting data in and request training (see Module 2). Preparing excel sheets for the tablet Preparing excel sheets to collect data on a tablet is very similar to preparing regular field sheets. In fact, the first step is the same: - download a field sheet from ForestPlots, - and format the field sheet to only see the columns that you want to work with. The next step is slightly different. Rather than set your print area, now you are going to lock columns that you do not want to accidentally modify in the field.
