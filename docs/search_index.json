Roundtable – everyone introduces their experience with digital data collection or data collection in general.

You can find everything you need on ForestPlots.net.   In order to access the data, you must Read the code of conduct, Register to have an account on ForestPlots here, and Email the associated country data officer to ensure the account is granted and to receive the necessary training to use ForestPlots. Note: Nika Gorski is the data officer for Africa data. Only once you have completed these steps will you be able to access data to ForestPlots and produce field sheets. If you haven’t fully completed these steps, you can still move on to Module 3 and 4 to install the necessary software on your laptop and tablet.

If you have not set up your devices, return to the section Setting up your devices. If you already have Excel on your tablet and laptop, then let’s get ready to collect some data. Upload the excel sheet to the tablet In the field we refer to the physical sheet of paper that we collect data on as the field sheet. For the sake of this course, we are going to refer to the physical field sheet as a field sheet. However, when we collect data with excel, we will call this an Excel sheet (just to help differentiate the field sheet types - this will make more sense later on). (ELIOTT insert instructions) Collect data on the tablet (ELIOTT insert instructions) Transfer data to a computer (ELIOTT insert instructions)   Exercise 1. Create a folder for the course called QGIS_training. 2. Download the pre-prepared excel sheet on your laptop (insert link to the excel file here later - need to decide if this will be a correctly locked field sheet or just a regular field sheet with no locking). 3. What do you notice about the excel sheet? Can you type in all of the columns? Is it easy to read? 4 Move the excel sheet from your laptop onto your tablet. 5. Disconnect the laptop and the tablet and fill in the excel sheet. 6. Save the filled in field excel on your computer. Discussion: How was the experience? What potential errors can you see?

Learn how to lock columns. Practice collecting data on an Excel field sheet.   Preparing field sheets on ForestPlots If you already know how to prepare field sheets through the ForestPlots database, skip ahead to the next section. If you need a refresher on how to create field sheets, watch this video or visit page 174 of the ForestPlots Manual. If you’ve never been shown how to make field sheets before by a ForestPlots team member, reach out to the data officer of the country that you will be collecting data in and request training (see Module 2). Preparing excel sheets for the tablet Preparing excel sheets to collect data on a tablet is very similar to preparing regular field sheets. In fact, the first step is the same: - download a field sheet from ForestPlots, - and format the field sheet to only see the columns that you want to work with. The next step is slightly different. Rather than set your print area, now you are going to lock columns that you do not want to accidentally modify in the field. (ELIOTT insert instructions and necessary images to show how to lock columns)   Exercise In your group create your own locked excel field sheet and decide which columns you believe are required for field work. Discussion: Compare group field sheets. What are the similarities and the differences among field sheets?

Create a folder called ABC_plot_practice in your QGIS_training folder. 4. Someone from the ForestPlots team has very kindly downloaded a ForestPlots field sheet for you (aren’t they amazing). Save this file in your ABC_plot_practice folder. 5. Create a locked Excel file following the guidelines that we discussed in Module 6 and call it ABC_excel_sheet. 6.
