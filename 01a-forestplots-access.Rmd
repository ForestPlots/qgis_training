# Accessing ForestPlots

When re-censusing a plot, you need access to the data from the previous censuses in order to make a field sheet to collect the data and to find the plot. All of this data is stored on [ForestPlots.net](ForestPlots.net).

In order to access the data, you must

1. Read the [code of conduct](https://forestplots.net/en/join-forestplots/code-of-conduct),   
2. Register to have an account on ForestPlots [here](https://forestplots.net/en/join-forestplots/user-gui), and    
3. Email the associated country data officer to ensure the account is granted and to receive the necessary training to use ForestPlots. *Note: Nika Gorski is the data officer for Africa data.*

Only once you have completed these steps will you be able to access data to ForestPlots and produce field sheets.

If you haven't fully completed these steps, you can still move on to `Module 3 and 4` to install the necessary software on your laptop and tablet.
