# (PART) Next Steps {-}

# Wrap Up

Here we can insert some next steps about what field leaders and PIs can be doing.

Also, we can add a piece about what we will be doing in the meantime (RShiny, updates, etc.)

insert extra resources for people (potential video that already exists?)

discuss a goal? (measuring number of plots with QGIS, who will be the focal person for each country, how do we bridge the gap between different institutions - sharing formats to go from one to another)

one day people have the autonomy to prepare their own data.

Reference people.
