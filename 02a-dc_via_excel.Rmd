- Understand how to collect ForestPlots data using Excel on a tablet


## Set up your computer {.unnumbered}

In order to collect data on your tablet via excel, you need two things: 

1. To stay organised and  
2. Excel  

Hopefully, you have already configured this in `Module 2 and 3`. If you have not set up your devices, return to the section `Setting up your devices`. 

If you already have Excel on your tablet and laptop, then let's get ready to collect some data.


## Upload the excel sheet to the tablet {-}

In the field we refer to the physical sheet of paper that we collect data on as the field sheet. For the sake of this course, we are going to refer to the physical field sheet as a field sheet. However, when we collect data with excel, we will call this an Excel sheet (just to help differentiate the field sheet types - this will make more sense later on).

## Exercise {-}

**1.** Create a folder for the course called `QGIS_training`.  

**2.** Download the pre-prepared excel sheet on your laptop (insert link to the excel file here later - *need to decide if this will be a correctly locked field sheet or just a regular field sheet with no locking*).  

**3.** What do you notice about the excel sheet? Can you type in all of the columns? Is it easy to read?

**4** Move the excel sheet from your laptop onto your tablet.  

**5.** Disconnect the laptop and the tablet and fill in the excel sheet.  

**6.** Save the filled in field excel on your computer.  

*Discussion: How was the experience? What potential errors can you see?*
